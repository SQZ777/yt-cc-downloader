start="113.439" dur="5.201">running performance which is what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="115.28" dur="6.4">called V2 Max so how much running do you</text><text start="118.64" dur="5.399">actually need to improve your V2 Max</text><text start="121.68" dur="4.92">first let&amp;#39;s quickly discuss what V2 Max</text><text start="124.039" dur="5.08">even is and why it matters for running</text><text start="126.6" dur="5.6">performance V2 Max is your body&amp;#39;s</text><text start="129.119" dur="5.84">ability to use oxygen efficiently at</text><text start="132.2" dur="5.039">high intense exercise think of V2 Max as</text><text start="134.959" dur="3.961">your body&amp;#39;s gas tank the bigger it is</text><text start="137.239" dur="4">the more potential you

you need to raise</text><text start="152.879" dur="6.201">your V2 Max to the highest possible</text><text start="155.599" dur="6.28">level so how do we improve V2 Max there</text><text start="159.08" dur="4.56">are really two key ways to do it you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="161.879" dur="4.44">probably heard about high-intensity</text><text start="163.64" dur="5.8">training so let me ask you a question if</text><text start="166.319" dur="5.801">high-intensity training is so important</text><text start="169.44" dur="6.56">why is it that long endurance athletes</text><text start="172.12" dur="7.16">tend to score the highest V2 Max scores</text><text start="176" dur="6.319">shouldn&amp;#39;t it be high intensity athletes</text><text start="179.28" dur="6.28">who had the highest V2 Max scores well a</text><text start="182.319" dur="6.161">study going all the way back to 1979</text><text start="185.56" dur="4.959">compared V2 Max scores in professional</text><text start="188.48"

Elite</text><text start="195.799" dur="4.241">Runners who do about 80% of their</text><text start="198" dur="5.84">training at low intensity they found</text><text start="200.04" dur="6.759">that V2 Max was 133% higher in the</text><text start="203.84" dur="5.679">runners which means that a great way to</text><text start="206.799" dur="5.36">increase your V2 Max is just doing a</text><text start="209.519" dur="4.961">tough of volume but what if you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="212.159" dur="4.481">want to spend hours and hours training</text><text start="214.48" dur="4.759">you guessed it research has shown that</text><text start="216.64" dur="5.519">high-intensity intervals are especially</text><text start="219.239" dur="5.041">great for enhancing V2 Max a study</text><text start="222.159" dur="4.961">published in the Journal of strength and</text><text start="224.28" dur="5.2">conditioning research in 2012 showed</text><text start="227.12" dur="5.319">that just six high-intensity interval</text><text start="229.48" dur="6.16">sessions completed in a period of 2 to 3</text><text start="232.439" dur="6.321">weeks boosted V2 Max by an average of</text><text start="235.64" dur="5.879">5.5% but how do you increase V2 Max with</text><text start="238.76" dur="5.36">the least amount of training possible</text><text start="241.519" dur="5.401">well now we know that to maximize our V2</text><text start="244.12" dur="4.839">Max we have to do a ton of volume and</text><text start="246.92" dur="4.879">high-intensity training but a study from</text><text start="248.959" dur="5.801">2012 wanted to know which type of</text><text start="251.799" dur="5.321">running increased V2 Max the most they</text><text start="254.76" dur="5.999">tested five different training methods</text><text start="257.12" dur="6.079">on a group of 55 men for 8 weeks they</text><text start="260.759" dur="5.401">compared four different training methods</text><text start="263.199" dur="6.121">long slow distance so running at 60% of</text><text start="266.16" dur="6.36">V2 Max for 45 minutes lactate threshold</text><text start="269.32" dur="6.879">training so running at around 80% of V2</text><text start="272.52" dur="6.84">Max for around 24 minutes 15 15</text><text start="276.199" dur="6.881">intervals so running 15 seconds at</text><text start="279.36" dur="6.839">87.5% of V2 Max and then 15 seconds easy</text><text start="283.08" dur="6.44">4x4 intervals so running 4 minutes at</text><text start="286.199" dur="6">87.5% of V2 Max and then 3 minutes easy</text><text start="289.52" dur="6.64">and what they called long quick distance</text><text start="292.199" dur="6.761">so running at 87.5% of V2 Max for around</text><text start="296.16" dur="5.12">22 minutes while this method was</text><text start="298.96" dur="4.799">introduced it was not included in the</text><text start="301.28" dur="4.8">final results so this is what they found</text><text start="303.759" dur="4.88">long slow distance running did not</text><text start="306.08" dur="5.8">improve V2 Max lactate threshold</text><text start="308.639" dur="6.361">training gave an improvement of 2% 155</text><text start="311.88" dur="5.159">intervals gave an improvement of 5.5%</text><text start="315" dur="4">and 4x4 minute intervals gave the</text><text start="317.039" dur="5">biggest Improvement of</text><text start="319" dur="5.639">7.2% so which workout is the most</text><text start="322.039" dur="4.6">effective for increasing V2 Max the</text><text start="324.639" dur="4.4">study is pretty clear two to three</text><text start="326.639" dur="4.84">sessions per week of 4x4 minute</text><text start="329.039" dur="5.521">intervals are the most effective but</text><text start="331.479" dur="5.481">here&amp;#39;s the thing V2 Max is complex and</text><text start="334.56" dur="5">in my experience doing a variety of</text><text start="336.96" dur="5">workouts will help you reach a higher V2</text><text start="339.56" dur="4.56">Max than doing the same thing over and</text><text start="341.96" dur="4.32">over again it just makes sense to train</text><text start="344.12" dur="4.48">from multiple different angles to</text><text start="346.28" dur="4.68">maximize your adaptations but before you</text><text start="348.6" dur="5.12">start to do 4x4 intervals let me show</text><text start="350.96" dur="5">you an even faster way to improve with</text><text start="353.72" dur="3.919">less effort most Runners think that</text><text start="355.96" dur="4.359">cutting their training means losing</text><text start="357.639" dur="5.601">Fitness but in 2012 re researchers</text><text start="360.319" dur="5.281">tested this exact question and what they</text><text start="363.24" dur="4.88">found was pretty mindblowing to be</text><text start="365.6" dur="4.8">honest the researchers tested if Runners</text><text start="368.12" dur="5.16">could literally cut their training in</text><text start="370.4" dur="5.4">half and still improve they took a group</text><text start="373.28" dur="5.08">of Runners who were running 30 km per</text><text start="375.8" dur="6.72">week and then they cut their training by</text><text start="378.36" dur="6.72">54% down to 14 km per week they then put</text><text start="382.52" dur="5.48">them through what they call the 10230</text><text start="385.08" dur="6.04">protocol for 7 weeks and the results</text><text start="388" dur="6.599">were mind-blowing there 1500 met times</text><text start="391.12" dur="7.72">improved by 21 seconds and their 5K</text><text start="394.599" dur="7.88">times improved by 48 seconds on average</text><text start="398.84" dur="5.56">they even improved their V2 Max by 4%</text><text start="402.479" dur="3.881">and again that was with half the</text><text start="404.4" dur="4.199">training of what they used to do so now</text><text start="406.36" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re probably wondering what was that</text><text start="408.599" dur="4">protocol they trained three times per</text><text start="410.56" dur="5.28">week and did the following interval</text><text start="412.599" dur="5.521">session 30 seconds at an easy jog 20</text><text start="415.84" dur="5">seconds at a moderate pace and 10</text><text start="418.12" dur="4.759">seconds all out they did that for five</text><text start="420.84" dur="3.88">times then had a 2-minute break then</text><text start="422.879" dur="4.32">they would do it again and they would</text><text start="424.72" dur="4.44">keep doing that for three to four sets</text><text start="427.199" dur="4.161">if you want a full protocol following</text><text start="429.16" dur="3.68">this exact method then I put one</text><text start="431.36" dur="3.2">together for you for free that you can</text><text start="432.84" dur="3.639">check out in the description below this</text><text start="434.56" dur="4.039">protocol will probably not make you run</text><text start="436.479" dur="4.081">a faster Marathon for that I think you</text><text start="438.599" dur="4">need a bit more volume but what if</text><text start="440.56" dur="3.44">you&amp;#39;re already running but you&amp;#39;ve heard</text><text start="442.599" dur="3.44">that you

start="523.12" dur="4.159">periods the researchers found that the</text><text start="525.04" dur="4.479">hopping group improved significantly</text><text start="527.279" dur="4.56">more than the non- hopping group in a</text><text start="529.519" dur="4.721">matter of just 6 weeks that basically</text><text start="531.839" dur="4.641">means that with just five minutes per</text><text

dur="6.641">do we actually need to live longer a</text><text start="548.76" dur="5.88">major study from 2015 followed 5,000</text><text start="552.48" dur="5.08">people some Runners and some

dur="4.881">were pretty interesting they made three</text><text start="562.24" dur="4.719">major conclusions the first finding was</text><text start="564.72" dur="4.88">that jogging less than one hour

dur="4.04">non-runners the second finding was that</text><text start="573.959" dur="4">to achieve the maximum amount of</text><text start="576.04" dur="4.64">benefits for the least amount of work</text><text start="577.959" dur="5.241">you need to do the following 1 to 2.4</text><text start="580.68" dur="4.159">hours of jogging per week and run two to</text><text start="583.2" dur="4.079">three times per week but here is where</text><text start="584.839" dur="5.161">it gets interesting the third finding</text><text start="587.279" dur="4.56">was that you can actually train too much</text><text start="590" dur="3.519">they found that jogging more than 2 and</text><text start="591.839" dur="4.281">1 half hours per week and more than</text><text start="593.519" dur="5.32">three times per week at faster Paces did</text><text start="596.12" dur="4.68">not significantly improve survival rate</text><text start="598.839" dur="3.761">so what is the minimum amount of running</text><text start="600.8" dur="4.12">you can do for longevity you can get</text><text start="602.6" dur="4.08">away with less than one session and one</text><text start="604.92" dur="3.64">hour per week but if you want to</text><text start="606.68" dur="3.839">maximize the benefits you should run</text><text start="608.56" dur="4.959">around two to three times per week with</text><text start="610.519" dur="4.921">a total volume of 1 to 2 and 1/2 hours</text><text start="613.519" dur="5.721">but I want to quickly note that this</text><text start="615.44" dur="6.48">does not factor in V2 Max and V2 Max is</text><text start="619.24" dur="5.12">one of the best predictors of all cuse</text><text start="621.92" dur="5.08">motality so in my personal opinion I</text><text start="624.36" dur="4.64">would probably add a V2 Max session or</text><text start="627" dur="3.64">two so how do you run like a minimalist</text><text start="629" dur="3.839">if you
