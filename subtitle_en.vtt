need to</text><text start="75.439" dur="4.32">calculate our heart rate training zones</text><text start="77.84" dur="3.56">there&amp;#39;s basically three different ways</text><text start="79.759" dur="4.36">you can do this the first one being</text><text start="81.4" dur="4.48">another form of some online calculators</text><text start="84.119" dur="3.521">these are very very generalized

dur="3.68">give you the very very very best data</text><text start="91.72" dur="3.24">now I&amp;#39;ve done this a few times who put</text><text start="93.04" dur="3.68">some footage of me in the lab is to go</text><text start="94.96" dur="4.799">into a lab and get your lactate</text><text start="96.72" dur="4.88">threshold and your V2 Max tested and as</text><text start="99.759" dur="3.961">part

dur="3.28">what&amp;#39;s going to appeal for most people</text><text start="111.84" dur="4.4">the middle ground between those two is</text><text start="113.64" dur="3.6">to test these out yourself and for this</text><text start="116.24" dur="3.32">you&amp;#39;re going to need to know your</text><text start="117.24" dur="4.12">maximum heart rate and also your resting</text><text start="119.56" dur="3.239">heart rate rate so to calculate your</text><text start="121.36" dur="3.32">maximum heart rate and I would always</text><text start="122.799" dur="3.96">say please get some medical advice if</text><text start="124.68" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re at all unsure and definitely you</text><text start="126.759" dur="3.801">should be doing this in a supervised</text><text start="128.52" dur="4.439">environment but you basically need to be</text><text start="130.56" dur="3.959">pushing yourself to the absolute limit</text><text start="132.959" dur="2.761">this is very very tough on the body</text><text start="134.519" dur="3.161">please don&amp;#39;t do this if you got</text><text start="135.72" dur="3.64">absolutely no running Fitness or you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="137.68" dur="3.639">feeling slightly ill now the best thing</text><text start="139.36" dur="4.56">is to do is to get yourself a heart rate</text><text start="141.319" dur="5.081">monitor a chest strap or at the very</text><text start="143.92" dur="3.92">least a arm band these will be far more</text><text start="146.4" dur="3.119">accurate than the heart rate monitors</text><text start="147.84" dur="4.28">that are built into some of our watches</text><text start="149.519" dur="4.08">these days these are very vague at best</text><text start="152.12" dur="3.68">they&amp;#39;re very good for looking at heart</text><text start="153.599" dur="3.841">rate longterm but for in the moment</text><text start="155.8" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re really not going to be accurate</text><text start="157.44" dur="3.36">enough for what we&amp;#39;re trying to achieve</text><text start="158.92" dur="3.36">here there&amp;#39;s a couple of options here of</text><text start="160.8" dur="3.719">what to do when you&amp;#39;re all set up heart</text><text start="162.28" dur="5.48">rate monitors ready to go the first one</text><text start="164.519" dur="5.72">is to run 400 m fairly hard fairly</text><text start="167.76" dur="4.96">intense and then another 400 m</text><text start="170.239" dur="3.92">absolutely flat out the maximum heart</text><text start="172.72" dur="4.12">rate will be somewhere towards that</text><text start="174.159" dur="4.121">second rep of 400 m and then you can</text><text start="176.84" dur="3.319">just look through the data and see where</text><text start="178.28" dur="3.8">your heart rate gets up to and another</text><text start="180.159" dur="4.16">option you can do here is to find a</text><text start="182.08" dur="4.28">decent Hill in your local area and then</text><text start="184.319" dur="3.92">progressively pick up speed pick up</text><text start="186.36" dur="4.599">intensity as you start running up that</text><text start="188.239" dur="4.761">hill do this for around about 60 seconds</text><text start="190.959" dur="3.881">for that rep and again then look at the</text><text start="193" dur="3.44">data afterwards super fit people might</text><text start="194.84" dur="3.64">want to repeat this two or three times</text><text start="196.44" dur="4.159">for those 400 m reps or two or three</text><text start="198.48" dur="4.24">times to do those Hill reps and just see</text><text start="200.599" dur="3.801">where that heart rate is spiking to at</text><text start="202.72" dur="2.96">the end of the data before you do this</text><text start="204.4" dur="2.399">you want to make sure you&amp;#39;re properly</text><text start="205.68" dur="3.119">warmed up you&amp;#39;re going to be getting</text><text start="206.799" dur="4.281">some very intense running straightaway</text><text start="208.799" dur="3.961">so i&amp;#39; say at least around 50 minutes of</text><text start="211.08" dur="3.6">super easy jogging lots of dynamic</text><text start="212.76" dur="3.08">stretching as well before you get going</text><text start="214.68" dur="2.44">if you are a little bit injured or a</text><text start="215.84" dur="2.52">little bit unwell or don&amp;#39;t want to go</text><text start="217.12" dur="2.759">out and do something like that straight</text><text start="218.36" dur="3.48">away go back and look at some of your</text><text start="219.879" dur="4.041">historical data from the last couple of</text><text start="221.84" dur="3.679">months leading up to where you are now</text><text start="223.92" dur="3.08">have you done a hill rep session have</text><text start="225.519" dur="4.121">you done some allout efforts have you</text><text start="227" dur="4.64">done a Max 5K for example just look</text><text start="229.64" dur="4.64">through that data if you&amp;#39;ve got reliable</text><text start="231.64" dur="4.76">chest strap or arm strap data have a</text><text start="234.28" dur="3.799">look see where it is peaking some of the</text><text start="236.4" dur="2.839">running apps as well such as Garing</text><text start="238.079" dur="3.201">things will be able to tell you what</text><text start="239.239" dur="3.801">your max heart rate is by reading the</text><text start="241.28" dur="3.239">data that is fed into it as well so</text><text start="243.04" dur="3.08">there you go you&amp;#39;ve got your maximum</text><text start="244.519" dur="3.321">heart rate data then we need to find out</text><text start="246.12" dur="3.72">our resting heart rate now what a</text><text start="247.84" dur="3.52">recommend here is to take your pulse</text><text start="249.84" dur="4.16">first thing in the morning just over the</text><text start="251.36" dur="4.239">course of maybe 2 or 3 days most modern</text><text start="254" dur="3.56">watches will give you a resting heart</text><text start="255.599" dur="3.48">rght data and this is going to be fairly</text><text start="257.56" dur="3.16">accurate watches these days with the</text><text start="259.079" dur="3.84">wrist-based heart rate are pretty good</text><text start="260.72" dur="4">at looking at long-term heart rate data</text><text start="262.919" dur="3.361">so I would trust the figure that your</text><text start="264.72" dur="3.36">watch is giving you if you have that</text><text start="266.28" dur="3.68">available to you so now we&amp;#39;ve got those</text><text start="268.08" dur="4.76">two figures and for Simplicity I&amp;#39;m going</text><text start="269.96" dur="5.12">to say my maximum heart rate is 180 and</text><text start="272.84" dur="3.6">my resting heart rate is 60 now again</text><text start="275.08" dur="3.2">there&amp;#39;s some online calculators where</text><text start="276.44" dur="3.759">you can plug these figures in that</text><text start="278.28" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;ve now calculated it will spit out</text><text start="280.199" dur="3.481">your exact heart rate training zones</text><text start="282.12" dur="3.88">again we&amp;#39;ll link to those down below lot</text><text start="283.68" dur="4.519">of links Down Below in this video but</text><text start="286" dur="5.039">for example maximum heart rate 180</text><text start="288.199" dur="5.761">resting heart rate 60 gives us a heart</text><text start="291.039" dur="5.481">rate reserve of 120 beats a minute this</text><text start="293.96" dur="4.519">is the range of what&amp;#39;s available to us</text><text start="296.52" dur="3.92">in our daily life basically the lowest</text><text start="298.479" dur="4.241">it will be and the highest it will be in</text><text start="300.44" dur="5.44">our current state of health so for Zone</text><text start="302.72" dur="5.84">one this is going to be 50 to 60% of our</text><text start="305.88" dur="5.879">heart rate Reserve very easy recovery</text><text start="308.56" dur="5.28">jogging zone two 60 to 70% of our heart</text><text start="311.759" dur="4.121">rate reserve for our easy runs our</text><text start="313.84" dur="3.52">conversational pace and also some of our</text><text start="315.88" dur="5.039">long runs as well to build that</text><text start="317.36" dur="5.119">endurance zone three 70 to 80% of our</text><text start="320.919" dur="3.241">heart rate Reserve this is going to be</text><text start="322.479" dur="4.881">some moderate intensity we don&amp;#39;t spend</text><text start="324.16" dur="6.12">too much time here in this Zone Zone 4</text><text start="327.36" dur="5.399">80 to 90% of our heart rate res this is</text><text start="330.28" dur="4.56">our Tempo our threshold efforts</text><text start="332.759" dur="4">intervals this builds performance it</text><text start="334.84" dur="4.24">builds speed it really helps to build</text><text start="336.759" dur="5.72">our ability to run faster and then</text><text start="339.08" dur="5">finally zone five 90 to 100% of our</text><text start="342.479" dur="3.44">heart rate Reserve this really is</text><text start="344.08" dur="4.04">reserved just for those race Sprint</text><text start="345.919" dur="3.921">finishes and really short intervals as</text><text start="348.12" dur="3.48">well and potentially some Hill reps and</text><text start="349.84" dur="3.919">things like that just when we&amp;#39;re peaking</text><text start="351.6" dur="3.76">right at the top of a rep so let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="353.759" dur="4.44">calculate our Zone 2 heart rate using</text><text start="355.36" dur="5.119">our data of 180 for our maximum and then</text><text start="358.199" dur="3.681">60 for our resting heart rate so our</text><text start="360.479" dur="3.321">really simple formula here for</text><text start="361.88" dur="4.759">calculating it is that percentage of our</text><text start="363.8" dur="4.799">heart rate Reserve plus adding back on</text><text start="366.639" dur="5.241">our resting heart rate so here we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="368.599" dur="6.561">looking for that 60 to 70% range so 0.6</text><text start="371.88" dur="5.28">for our 60% Times by 120 for our heart</text><text start="375.16" dur="5.08">rate reserve and then add on 60 which</text><text start="377.16" dur="5.52">gives our lowest value of 132 beats a</text><text start="380.24" dur="4.48">minute which is where our Zone 2 Section</text><text start="382.68" dur="4.4">starts and then our upper end of that</text><text start="384.72" dur="5.8">zone here we&amp;#39;re looking for that 70% so</text><text start="387.08" dur="5.04">0.7 times 120 for our heart rate Reserve</text><text start="390.52" dur="4.88">adding on that 60 for our wrestling</text><text start="392.12" dur="6.519">heart rate gives us 144 so our Zone 2</text><text start="395.4" dur="5.96">heart rate section in our example is 132</text><text start="398.639" dur="4.241">to 144 beats a minute but what do we do</text><text start="401.36" dur="3.279">with this data now we&amp;#39;ve got it well</text><text start="402.88" dur="3.319">like with anything the more you practice</text><text start="404.639" dur="3.161">something the better you&amp;#39;re going to get</text><text start="406.199" dur="3.961">at it and in this instance it&amp;#39;s that</text><text start="407.8" dur="4.76">zone two that easy Pace running we want</text><text start="410.16" dur="4.96">to be practicing so for your easy runs</text><text start="412.56" dur="4.6">around about 80% of our total weekly</text><text start="415.12" dur="4.04">volume put your heart rate monitor on</text><text start="417.16" dur="4.12">your chest strap or your

dur="3.959">running you can set up alerts on your</text><text start="425.319" dur="4.72">watch if it goes too high or too low</text><text start="427.759" dur="4.88">just to keep yourself dialed in in

dur="4.401">definitely included in this running in</text><text start="436.08" dur="4.88">zone 2 will feel painfully slow and it</text><text start="439" dur="3.759">can be quite frustrating you feel like</text><text start="440.96" dur="3.799">you&amp;#39;re hardly moving but believe me</text><text start="442.759" dur="4.201">stick with this and you will speed up</text><text start="444.759"
